# Loopring Audit

The Argus audit team performed a security audit of the [Loopring protocol](https://github.com/Loopring/protocol) and worked with the Loopring core engineers to resolve findings from the review. At this time, no major vulnerabilities remain to be found that put funds at immediate risk. This is our final audit report of the Loopring protocol, published on November 25, 2017.

Our final audit report of the Loopring protocol is available in [PDF form](./LoopringAudit.pdf).

## Overview

The Argus audit team was contracted by Loopring to perform a security audit of the [Loopring protocol](https://github.com/Loopring/protocol) on October 29, 2017. The team conducted a three week security audit of the Loopring protocol at tag [v1.0-beta.2](https://github.com/Loopring/protocol/tree/v1.0-beta.2). Our findings were reported to the Loopring team on November 22, 2017, and necessary updates were made to the protocol implementation between November 22-24, 2017. The final audit report was submitted to the Loopring team on November 25, 2017.

The review process comprised of individual inspections of the Loopring protocol by members of the audit team, followed by a group review of the codebase, tests, documentation, and supporting information. Proprietary and open-source tools were employed to determine the safety and correctness of the protocol implementation. Following discussions addressing our findings with the Loopring team, no major smart contract code vulnerabilities remain to be found that put funds at immediate risk.

This is the final audit report of the Loopring protocol, completed on November 25, 2017. The final audit report includes documentation of protocol functions, general findings from our security audit, specific findings from our analysis, and reports from code coverage and code analysis tools.
